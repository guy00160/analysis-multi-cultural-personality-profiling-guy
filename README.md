# Multi-Cultural Personality Profiling & Classifying The Israeli Profile

## Goals

The primary goal of this project was to learn about the Israeli personality profile. Specifically, we aimed to determine a cultural classification for the Israeli profile among three prominent cultures: The West, The Arab World, and The Far East.

To achieve this, we created personality profiles for diverse countries representing these different cultures and compared their personality traits to those of Israelis. We hypothesized that the Israeli profile could be classified as Western, but were open to other possibilities. One particularly interesting outcome would be if the Israeli profile showed distinct differences from all three cultures.

Additionally, we aimed to identify intriguing differences between the various cultures and countries included in the study.

## How to Use

The HTML file covers the practical portion of the project and is well-documented, making it sufficient for those primarily interested in the data preprocessing and results. This file was generated from the RMarkdown (RMD) file, which contains the code and is also included among the files. We highly recommend downloading (then using) the HTML file to view the project.

The Word documents are in Hebrew and contain the research and justifications for the choices made throughout the project. The "Report - Preprocessing and Analysis" file includes English tables that summarize the results. You can use the table of contents to navigate to these tables even if you do not understand Hebrew, as the personality traits are listed in both English and Hebrew.

Additionally, there is an English presentation (PowerPoint) and an English poster available that summarize key parts of the project.
